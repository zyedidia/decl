# Deterministic Client Artifact

Deterministic Client (DeCl) is an extension of LFI for enforcing determinism
and deterministic metering on native code. This repository contains the
artifact for the research prototype of DeCl, which can be used to reproduce the
experiments from our paper.

Some components are external: see https://github.com/scslab/smart-contract-scalability
for the implementation of Groundhog, and https://github.com/zyedidia/codegram for
the code that is used to construct and use the BDD.

The SPEC 2017 benchmarks require you to separately have access to SPEC. If you
have questions about how to run the benchmarks please contact <span>z</span><span>y</span><span>e</span><span>d</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>i</span><span>a</span><span>@</span><span>s</span><span>t</span><span>a</span><span>n</span><span>f</span><span>o</span><span>r</span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>e</span><span>d</span><span>u</span>
