Since SPEC is not publicly available, we only provide our configuration
scripts, benchmarking script to invoke the SPEC runner, and patches we applied
to SPEC to make it work with WebAssembly/Musl/LLVM 19.

You'll also need the `specinvoke` program from `decl-runtime`. See the readme there for info it.
